# LevelSetTopOpt.jl
Welcome to the documentation for `LevelSetTopOpt.jl`!

## Introduction
`LevelSetTopOpt.jl` is computational toolbox for level set-based topology optimisation implemented in Julia and the Gridap package ecosystem. The core design principle of `LevelSetTopOpt.jl` is to provide an extendable framework for solving optimisation problems in serial or parallel with a high-level programming interface and automatic differentiation. See the following publication for further details:
