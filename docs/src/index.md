# GridapTopOpt.jl
Welcome to the documentation for `GridapTopOpt.jl`!

## Introduction
`GridapTopOpt.jl` is computational toolbox for level set-based topology optimisation implemented in Julia and the Gridap package ecosystem. The core design principle of `GridapTopOpt.jl` is to provide an extendable framework for solving optimisation problems in serial or parallel with a high-level programming interface and automatic differentiation. See the following publication for further details:
